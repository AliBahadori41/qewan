## Qewam app

How to run and test:
- I've added a postman collection to the root folder of the project for testing endpoints.
- To run project you need to use the following command: `./vendor/bin/sail up` this will setup the docker container.
- After successfully running previous command, then run migration and seeder: `./vendor/bin/sail migrate --seed`
- And then everthing is up to use and test :)
